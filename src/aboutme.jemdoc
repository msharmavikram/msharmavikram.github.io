= About Me 

I grew up in a small village called Ballya in India (place does not exit in wiki). My home is far from bustling city and also mobile coverage (and ofcourse internet)! 
The village is covered with lust ever-green forest on all sides and has amazing sun-rise views as it very close to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Ghats Western Ghats].
As you might have expected, we are basically agriculturist and grow variety of food products. 
The natives of the village speak a regional language called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulu_language Tulu] which dates back to several centuries. 
However, my mother tongue is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havigannada_dialect Havyaka], a variant of old-kannada dialect. 
Oh, I forgot to mention, we live in harmony with elephants, leopards, snakes and peacocks (Indian Peafowl). 
So if you are wild life photographer, you found the right destination.  

= Personal Interests
I am avid photographer and hiker. Some of the photos I have taken can be found [https://instagram.com/msharmavikram here]. 

Apart from photography, I enjoy cooking Indian vegetarian cuisine. In-fact some of my friends have even named some of my foods such as [putturchips]!
