== Short Bio

Vikram is a Research Scientist at [https://research.nvidia.com/ NVIDIA Research]. 
He classifies him as systems and platform researcher and a computer architect focusing on GPU memory/storage system design. 
He is interested in solving fundamental systems-level problems and proposing optimizations for emerging applications. 
Vikram has extensive experience in memory and storage system design, GPUs, and performance optimizations for emerging applications like NLP, recommender systems, GNNs, and graph and data analytics. 
Vikram holds a Ph.D. in [https://ece.illinois.edu/ Electrical and Computer Engineering] from the [https://illinois.edu/ University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign], in 2022. 
He completed his dissertation under the supervision of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wen-mei_Hwu Professor Wen-mei Hwu] at the [http://impact.crhc.illinois.edu IMPACT Research Group]. 
In his dissertation, he discussed application support and adaptation for high-throughput accelerator orchestrated fine-grain storage access. 
Vikram is a recipient of the [https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/grad/fellowships/bahl Bahl Fellowship] for 2019–21 and the [https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/grad/fellowships/vivoli Dan Vivoli Endowed Fellowship] for 2021–22 and has won several competitions, including the Championship award for the [http://graphchallenge.mit.edu/champions HPEC’20 Graph Challenge] and multiple student innovation awards in competitions. 
His work has been featured in [https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/14/nvidia_gpu_data/ TheRegister], [https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-unveils-big-accelerator-memory-solid-state-storage-for-gpus TomsHardware], [https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidias-big-accelerator-memory-an-ssd-for-your-gpu/ PCGamer], [https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/nvidia-wants-to-speed-up-data-transfer-by-connecting-data-center-gpus-to-ssds/ ArsTechnica], and [https://www.google.com/search?q=bam+big+accelerator+memory&oq=bam+big+accelerator+memory more]. 


#I am interested in achieving SOL performance by understanding the application (end-to-end), optimizing and then proposing/implementing novel software/hardware stack. 
#Currently, I am looking into accelerator memory capacity and bandwidth challenges in emerging applications like deep learning, recommender systems, GNNs, and graph and data analytics. 

#Vikram is a final year Ph.D. Candidate at Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign. 
#Vikram's core research area proposes solutions to address the memory capacity and bandwidth challenges present in modern systems and accelerators. 
#Vikram is also interested in disaggregated data center designs, non-volatile memories and SSD storage, near/in memory or storage accelerators, end-to-end system architecture, and programming model for emerging applications like deep learning, recommender systems, GNNs, and graph and data analytics. 
#His Ph.D. work discusses enabling efficient GPU or Accelerator-centric system architecture for emerging applications (refer to Erudite for more details).
##His research interests spans from machine learning applications to system architecture and programming of emerging processors and memory technologies (NVM, SSDs, etc) for GPUs and near-memory/storage accelerators. 


#Vikram currently works with the IMPACT Research Group led by Prof. Wen-mei Hwu and at NVIDIA Research as a part-time research intern. 
#Vikram is a recipient of Bahl Fellowship for 2019-21 and Dan Vivoli Endowed Fellowship for 2021-22.
#Prior to graduate program, he worked at Intel and LSI Corporation as Design engineer for three and one year, respectively. 
#He received his B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering at B.M.S College of Engineering, Bangalore.
#
#In his free time, Vikram is into photography, hiking or cooking delicious food.
