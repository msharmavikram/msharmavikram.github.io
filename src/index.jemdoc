== Short Bio
Vikram is a PhD Candidate at Electrical and Computer Engineering Department  of University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign.
His research interests spans from machine learning applications to system architecture and programming of emerging processors and memory technologies (NVM, SSDs, etc) for GPUs and near-memory/storage accelerators. His PhD work is concentrated on enabling efficient GPU or Accelerator-centric system architecture for emerging applications (refer [publications/paper/paper-erudite-arxiv.pdf Erudite] for more details). 

Vikram currently works with the IMPACT Research Group led by Prof. Wen-mei Hwu. He is a recipient of Bahl Fellowship for 2019-21.
Prior to graduate program, he worked at Intel and LSI Corporation as Design engineer for three and one year, respectively. 
He received his B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering at B.M.S College of Engineering, Bangalore.

In his free time, Vikram is into photography, hiking or cooking delicious food (as other says).
